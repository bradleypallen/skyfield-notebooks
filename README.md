Inspired by a thread on Seesat (see, e.g. Seesat-l Digest, Vol 63,
Issue 3) I began looking at how various tasks of interest to amateur
satellite observers could be done using Python notebooks. In my
investigations I encountered the Skyfield Python astronomy package and
began using that in earnest, with positive results. This repository
contains a number of notebooks I am currently working on.

## Learning Skyfield

This notebook contains some initial looks at almanac calculations, use
of the Hipparcos star catalog, and plotting star fields. Consider this
as a scratchpad.

## Satellite Predictions Using Skyfield

This notebook attempts to recreate the satellite pass tables and charts that
the Heavens Above website generates.

## Charts using Skyfield

This notebook is a place were we're working with various ways to plot sky charts.
